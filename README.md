My personal website – A symbiosis of silent coding,
where creativity meets quiet hours and code becomes identity.

## About

A digital craftsmanship manifesto.
This is my _Manufaktur für digitale Askese_ – a space where over two decades
of development, failure, and insight have merged into substance.
Condensed into a place for clarity, attitude, and digital reflection.

Built with **Astro 5.1** – TypeScript first, no CSS overhead, raw and robust.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro 5.1** - Static Site Generator
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Minimal approach** - No unnecessary dependencies
- **MVP focused** - Clean, authentic, and direct

## Development
